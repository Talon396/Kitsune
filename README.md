# About

Kitsune is a lightweight, modular text editor. Kitsune uses C++ for it's backend, while most of the editor's code is written in Lua.
Kitsune was built to create a text editor that would better suite my workflow, I wanted something that was easy to use, and had little clutter with it,
so I decided to create my own text editor. Kitsune is largely inspired by rxi's lite, which was also mostly written in Lua and uses a similar UI design.
